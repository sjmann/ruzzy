fuzzy matching algorithms written (poorly) in rust

## Currently Implemented:

* Levenshtein Distance (very simple, needs refactor to be more idiomatic)

## TODO

* Damerau-Levenshtein distance
* [Longest Common Substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring_problem)
* [n-gram](https://bytes.com/topic/access/insights/910886-ngram-approximate-string-matching)
* [Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex)
